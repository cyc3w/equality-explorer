DESIGN QUESTIONS

Solving screen:
- is the organize button relevant? (it's shown in mockups)
- is universal operator visible only when locked?
- multi-touch: When you start dragging something on one plate, does the corresponding thing on the other plate become non-interactive?
- multi-touch: What happens when universal operation is applied while an item is being dragged?
- multi-touch: What happens when x value is changed while an x item is being dragged?

IMPLEMENTATION

Clicking on items (on scale or in panels) doesn't deselect snapshot, presumably because of DAG item icons.
See SnapshotAccordionBox clickToDeselectListener.  Why isn't this an issue with 1,-1,x,-x, only with Image nodes?

Locked mode, #19

Solving screen - generalize other screens? different implementation?

Consider subtypes instead of constructor comparison, especially in ItemNode (search for ".constructor")

Reset All takes awhile to complete, even with nothing on scale
