DESIGN QUESTIONS

Solving screen:
- is the organize button relevant? (it's shown in mockups)
- is universal operator visible only when locked?
- multi-touch: When you start dragging something on one plate, does the corresponding thing on the other plate become non-interactive?
- multi-touch: What happens when universal operation is applied while an item is being dragged?
- multi-touch: What happens when x value is changed while an x item is being dragged?

IMPLEMENTATION

Locked mode, #19

Restore snapshot

Solving screen - generalize other screens? different implementation?

Reconsider model architecture. State is spread across AbstratctItemCreator and Plate, duplicate info about what is on the Plate.

Consider subtypes instead of constructor comparison, especially in ItemNode (search for ".constructor")
