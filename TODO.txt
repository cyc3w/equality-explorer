TODO items for equality-explorer

DESIGN QUESTIONS

Reconsider "white box" feature

Snapshots: Is position of items on scale saved and restored?

Item limits (proposed by AM in Slack):
Basics: 36 total items, any combination
Numbers: 18 of each item
Variables: 9 of each item, so thereâ€™s always space for inverses to appear.
Solving: no limits

Arrow color when unbalanced, use something other than orange?

REQUIREMENTS

Ghost moves y-proportionally below the plate. Above the plate tracks exactly. x-axis movement is tracked exactly.

Animation of ghost and dragged item occurs such that they arrive at their cells at same time.

If left plate is full, can still drag out of right panel, but items will always fly back to panels.

1 and -1 (or x and -x) combined to 0, which then fades ala Expression Exchange.

x range is [-40,40]

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IMPLEMENTATION

Variables: put x, -x, 1, -1 on right plate. Equation is messed up, shows '0 = 1[x] + 1[-x] + +'

Add couplers that open/close but don't constraint anything, so we can play around while discussing

Reduce x and -x terms in equation, show symbol instead of icons

Hook up x and -x to VariablesModel.variableValueProperty

Combine inverses to create '0'
