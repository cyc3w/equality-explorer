TODO items for equality-explorer

Ideas
- Treat items as specialized terms?
- Always have terms in the model, use these for equations (and snapshots?)
- Indicate which representation to use on scale: items or terms
- Grid depends on which representation (items, terms) is shown on the scale
- Grid allowed to contain any type of EqualityExplorerMovable (items or terms)

Universal operation
- sum-to-zero animation should not be shown on Reset or Reset All

Solving screen
- show terms on scale instead of individual items
- drag items to scale to add to terms
- drag terms to panel
- fractional coefficients and constants
- universal operation
- sum item + term to zero
- sum term + term to zero

Locked mode, #19
- item dragged from panel
- item dragged from scale
- term dragged from scale
- mode change while drag is in progress (ignore mode change?)

Cleanup
- grunt update-copyright-dates
