DESIGN QUESTIONS

Reconsider "white box" feature

Should we put a fontawesome lock icon on the scale when coupling is on?

Snapshots UI has usability issues

Solving screen:
- is the organize button relevant? (it's shown in mockups)
- is universal operator visible only when coupled?
- is the "sum to zero" feature present? what does it look like with big terms on scale?
- do terms on plate get bigger/smaller depending on their value? or are they always big?
- if terms on plate are always big, does dragging item 'x' onto term 'x' look/feel odd?
- multi-touch: When you start dragging something on one plate, does the corresponding thing on the other plate become non-interactive?
- multi-touch: What happens when universal operation is applied while an item is being dragged?
- multi-touch: What happens when x value is changed while an x item is being dragged?

IMPLEMENTATION

Locked mode, #19

Snapshots
- save and restore the user's arrangement of items on the scale
- save and restore 'x' value
- show 'x=N' in snapshots, based on a new toggle control in the button group

Solving screen - generalize other screens? different implementation?

Reconsider model architecture. State is spread across ItemCreator and Plate, duplicate info about what is on the Plate.

Consider subtypes instead of constructor comparison, especially in ItemNode (search for ".constructor")
