DESIGN QUESTIONS

Items for Basics screen, https://github.com/phetsims/equality-explorer/issues/6

Rethink UI for coupling, https://github.com/phetsims/equality-explorer/issues/11

Reconsider "white box" feature

Snapshots: Is position of items on scale saved and restored?

Item limits (proposed by AM in Slack):
Basics: 36 total items, any combination
Numbers: 18 of each item
Variables: 9 of each item, so thereâ€™s always space for inverses to appear.
Solving: no limits

Drop shadow on dragged items?

Solving: When you start dragging something on one plate, does the corresponding thing on the other plate
become non-interactive?

Solving: What happens when universal operation is applied while an item is being dragged?

Solving: What happens when the variable value is changed while the "composite x" item is being dragged?

Conflicting uses of color coding: items, arrow, plates, panels

Arrow color when unbalanced, use something other than orange?

Migrate design decisions from Slack to Google doc

REQUIREMENTS

Ghost moves y-proportionally below the plate. Above the plate tracks exactly. x-axis movement is tracked exactly.

Animation of ghost and dragged item occurs such that they arrive at their cells at same time.

If left plate is full, can still drag out of right panel, but items will always fly back to panels.

1 and -1 (or x and -x) combined to 0, which then fades ala Expression Exchange.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IMPLEMENTATION

Dynamically size Variables accordion box to match Snapshots accordion box.

Size all panels the same way, by specifying contentWidth and contentHeight, not by hijacking maxWidth and maxHeight

Item type hierarchy: ConstantItem, VariableItem
                                       
Reduce x and -x terms in equation, show symbol instead of icons (and remove temporary hack in EquationNode)

Hook up x and -x to VariablesModel.variableValueProperty

Combine inverses to create '0'
