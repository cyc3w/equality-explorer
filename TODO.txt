Lock feature, #19
- how to detect whether Term came from toolbox or plate, and not snagged while animating?
- who is responsible for creating ghost Term? does it differ for toolbox vs plate?
- how it interactivity disabled for a ghost TermNode?
- how should the ghost Term be managed? as a field in an interactive Term?

- term dragged from toolbox to scale, term's plate is full
- term dragged from toolbox to scale, ghost's plate is full
- term dragged from scale to scale, ghost available on scale
- term dragged from scale to scale, ghost requires creating inverse on scale
- term dragged from scale to scale, ghost requires creating inverse on scale, inverse removed from scale
- term dragged from scale to toolbox, ghost available on scale
